                    Solar energy is a form of renewable energy that is available
                    without any limit and can be used for our need. Solar energy
                    cannot be destroyed. It doesn’t pollute or affect any other
                    things. But is using this kind of energy really as harmless
                    as it sounds?

                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    Tesla solar panel system is made up of three basic parts:
                    solar panels, an inverter and a solar gateway. Solar panels
                    capture the sunlight hitting the roof and convert it into
                    electricity. A solar inverter connected to solar panels
                    converts this electricity into the clean energy that can
                    power the lights and appliances in your home. The solar
                    energy powering your home decreases the amount of energy you
                    need to draw from the grid, lowering your electricity bill.
                    Solar gateway captures system’s information and allows users
                    to monitor the energy production through the Tesla app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At night, the solar system will turn off and a house will be
                    powered by the electric grid. During this time, the electric
                    utility’s meter will record how much energy the home is
                    using, as it does today. Alternatively, Tesla offers
                    Powerwall to store the excess solar a home generates and use
                    this energy at night, which would enable you to achieve a
                    self-powered home.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When the sun is shining, the power that is generated by the
                    solar system on your roof will flow into your home’s
                    electric panel. As your system generates more power than
                    your home can immediately consume, your electric meter will
                    reflect as such. Some utility meters will stand still, while
                    bidirectional meters will spin backwards when solar energy
                    is powering your home. Your electric bill will show zero
                    usage during that time. During a sunny summer day, your
                    solar panels may produce more power than your home needs. At
                    that time, your solar system will be fully powering your
                    home and all the excess power will flow backward through
                    your electric meter, where it will be consumed by other
                    houses and businesses connected to the grid.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tesla’s propriety mounting system allows the panels to sit
                    low on your roof with minimal gaps between panels. Their
                    solar systems are designed to blend in with your roof using
                    all-black panels and integrated side skirts that conceal
                    edges and protect your system from debris.
                </p>
                <p>There are three types of solar panels:</p>
                <table>
                    <thead>
                        <tr>

                            <th>Thin-film</th>
                        </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr>
                            <td>
                                <p>
                                    Monocrystalline solar panels are made from a
                                    single-crystal silicon, which is the purest
                                    form of silicon. This type of solar panel is
                                    the most efficient and expensive type of
                                    solar panel.

                                    Polycrystalline solar panels are made from a
                                    multi-crystal silicon, which is a less pure
                                    form of silicon than monocrystalline solar
                                    panels. This type of solar panel is less
                                    efficient and less expensive than
                                    monocrystalline solar panels.
                                </p>

                                    Thin-film solar panels are made from a
                                    semiconductor material that is deposited on
                                    a substrate. This type of solar panel is the
                                    least efficient and least expensive type of
                                    solar panel.

                <h2>Benefits</h2>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest benefits of a Tesla solar panel system is
                    its aesthetic appeal. Typical solar installations include
                    skirting in an effort to hide all solar panel mounting
                    hardware from the ground view, ensuring seamless integration
                    into the roofing material. Tesla’s panels are also black in
                    appearance, which ensures the panels are as aesthetically
                    pleasing as possible.
                </p>
                <p>Other benefits from going solar include:</p>

                        <h3>Savings</h3>
                        <p>
                            Homes with solar panels rely less on the grid by
                            capturing energy directly from the sun. Homeowners
                            can offset their energy usage with solar panels and
                            reduce their energy bills. By installing a solar
                            panel system, you can take control of your energy
                            usage and lower your costs.

                        <h3>Protect Yourself from Rising Electricity Rate</h3>
                        <p>
                            Electricity rates continue to increase over time -
                            since 1970 the price of electricity has increased
                            over 3% per year on average. In contrast, energy
                            from your solar system has a fixed price. With
                            solar, you won’t have to worry about how the price
                            of your electricity will change in the future.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Reduce Your Carbon Footprint</h3>
                        <p>
                            Electricity from the grid is generated by a mix of
                            coal, natural gas, nuclear and some renewable energy
                            depending on where you live. Solar gives you a
                            choice in where your energy comes from. By switching
                            to solar, you will be reducing your carbon emissions
                            and environmental impact of energy use.

                        <h3>Secure Your Home from Outages</h3>
                        <p>
                            While solar alone does not function during a power
                            outage, pairing your solar panels with a Powerwall
                            allows you to recharge with sunlight and keep your
                            appliances running even when the grid goes down.
                            Tesla Powerwall is designed to integrate with solar
                            panels and can store energy generated during the
                            day, for use at night or during unexpected outages
                            and grid shut-offs.

                    <div>
                        <p>
                            Solar cells are made with crystalline silicon that
                            is melted and mixed with gallium or boron to form
                            wafers called silicon ingot. Phosphorous is then
                            added to the silicon, and along with the gallium or
                            boron, these substances give silicon its electrical
                            capability. The silicon ingot is then cut into thin
                            sheets and an anti-reflective coating is applied to
                            capture the sunlight instead of reflecting it away
                            from the panels. Thin lines are then cut into the
                            cells to capture and move the electrical current
                            within the cell.

                        <p>
                            The solar cells become semiconductors of electricity
                            which is generated by the photovoltaic effect, when
                            the sunlight's photons are absorbed, electrons then
                            drift within the solar cells to create energy.

                <h2>Tesla's Partnership</h2>
                <p>
                    Until recently, Tesla had a partnership with international
                    electronics giant Panasonic to create Tesla solar panels.
                    The partnership was based around using the highly-regarded
                    <b>Panasonic HIT cells</b> to create Tesla’s solar panels.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After Panasonic’s departure from solar cell production for
                    Tesla, we understand that Tesla no longer manufactures its
                    solar panels. Instead, it appears to be using third-party
                    manufacturers to source solar panels for installation jobs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With Panasonic out of the picture, Tesla first switched to
                    using solar panels from <b>Qcells</b>. Then in April 2021,
                    Tesla announced the launch of its own solar panel, the
                    <b>Tesla T420S</b>. Since then, homeowners getting solar
                    panels from Tesla have been offered either Tesla-branded
                    solar panels or solar panels from Qcells.

                <h2>Labor Cost</h2>

                <p>
                    As of 2011, manufacturers in China accounted for 63 percent
                    of all solar-panel production worldwide. But a detailed
                    analysis of all costs associated with PV production shows
                    that the main contributors to that country’s lower PV prices
                    are <b>economies of scale</b> and <b>well-developed supply chains</b> —
                    not cheap labor.

                    <img src="assets/workers.png" alt="" />
                </div>
                <p>
                    While China does indeed have a small advantage in labor
                    costs, it has relatively little impact on prices because
                    solar-panel manufacturing is highly automated. The lower
                    cost of labor in China provides an advantage of 7 cents per
                    watt, relative to a factory in the United States, but that
                    amount is countered by other country-specific factors, such
                    as higher inflation.

                <p>
                    As of 2021, China possessed 72% of the world’s polysilicon
                    manufacturing capacity, 98% of ingots, 97% of wafers, 81% of
                    cells, and 77% of modules. 75% of the silicon solar cells
                    incorporated into modules installed in the United States are
                    produced by Chinese subsidiaries operating in three
                    Southeast Asian countries: <b>Vietnam</b>, <b>Malaysia</b>,
                    and <b>Thailand</b>.

                    The two largest tracker vendors were the U.S. firms
                    NEXTracker and Array Technologies, collectively representing
                    70% of 2020 U.S. tracker shipments, and 46% of 2020 global
                    tracker shipments. Globally, in 2020, 66% of PV inverters
                    were manufactured by companies headquartered in China.
                    However, the U.S. market relied more on inverters from
                    companies headquartered in Europe and Japan.

                        <h3>Recycling</h3>
                        <p>
                            What happens when solar panels break or are
                            decommissioned? Although solar panel recycling has
                            not become a major issue yet, it will in the coming
                            years as solar panels need to be replaced.
                            Currently, solar modules can be disposed of with
                            other standard e-waste. Countries without robust
                            e-waste disposal means are at a higher risk of
                            recycling related issues.

                        <h3>Chemicals</h3>
                        <p>
                            To produce solar-grade silicon, semi-conductor
                            processing typically involves hazardous chemicals.
                            Depending on the solar panel manufacturer and
                            country of origin, these chemicals may or may not be
                            disposed of properly. Unfortunately, there are
                            companies that try to cut corners to save cash. Not
                            every company avoids dumping chemicals or recycles
                            their byproducts properly.

                        <h3>Energy Demand</h3>
                        <p>
                            Solar requires a significant amount of energy up
                            front to produce. Mining, manufacturing, and
                            transportation all require substantial amounts of
                            energy. Quartz must be processed, cleaned, and then
                            manufactured with other components which may come
                            from different facilities to produce a single solar
                            module. Heating the quartz during the processing
                            stage requires very high heat. Manufacturing
                            requires combining multiple materials with
                            incredible precision to create high-efficiency
                            panels. All of this requires lots of up-front
                            energy. With traditional fuels such as gas or coal,
                            they are extracted, cleaned or processed, and burned
                            at very large scales, typically in a single
                            location.

                <h2>Recycling</h2>
                <p>
                    Waste from end-of-life solar panels presents opportunities
                    to recover valuable materials and create jobs through
                    recycling. According to the International Renewable Energy
                    Agency, by 2030, the cumulative value of recoverable raw
                    materials from end-of-life panels globally will be about
                    $450 million, which is equivalent to the cost of raw
                    materials currently needed to produce about 60 million new
                    panels. Diverting solar panels from landfills to recycling
                    saves space in landfills in addition to capturing the value
                    of the raw materials.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Crystalline-silicon solar technology represents most of the
                    solar panel market share. This type of panel is constructed
                    with an aluminum frame, glass, copper wire, polymer layers
                    and a backsheet, silicon solar cells, and a plastic junction
                    box. The polymer layers seal the panel from exposure to
                    weather but can make recycling and panel disassembling
                    difficult, as high temperatures are often required to loosen
                    the adhesive.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Many of these components can be recycled. Glass composes
                    most of the weight of a solar panel (about 75 percent), and
                    glass recycling is already a well-established industry.
                    Other materials that are easily recyclable include the
                    aluminum frame, copper wire, and plastic junction box.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Other materials located within the solar cells may be more
                    difficult to recycle. Silver and internal copper are
                    valuable components, but panels typically contain very small
                    amounts of these materials. Toxic metals like lead and
                    cadmium may also be present in solar panels.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another way to keep solar panels out of landfills is through
                    <b>panel reuse</b>, either by direct reuse or after
                    refurbishment. When reused, solar panels get a second life
                    generating clean energy at a different location. The
                    secondary market has not yet gained traction in the United
                    States, and regulatory considerations include electrical
                    grid interconnection regulations, and fire, building, and
                    electrical codes that must be examined when planning for
                    solar panel reuse. However, there are many beneficial ways
                    solar panels could be reused in situations where they aren’t
                    connected to the electrical grid, including electric bike or
                    vehicle charging stations, or other remote locations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When solar panels do reach their end of their life today,
                    they face a few possible fates. Under E.U. law, producers
                    are required to ensure their solar panels are recycled
                    properly. In Japan, India, and Australia, recycling
                    requirements are in the works. In the United States, it’s
                    the Wild West: with the exception of a state law in
                    Washington,
                    <b>the U.S. has no solar recycling mandates</b> whatsoever.
                    Only 5 US states – California, Hawaii, New Jersey, North
                    Carolina, Washington – have enacted laws, regulations, and
                    policies impacting solar panel waste. Voluntary,
                    industry-led recycling efforts are limited in scope.
                    <i
                        >“Right now, we’re pretty confident the number is around
                        10 percent of solar panels recycled,”</i
                    >
                    said Sam Vanderhoof, the CEO of Recycle PV Solar, one of the
                    only U.S. companies dedicated to PV recycling. The rest, he
                    says, go to landfills or are exported overseas for reuse in
                    developing countries with weak environmental protections.

                <p>
                    Vanderhoof says that the <b>cost of recycling</b> that panel
                    in the U.S. is anywhere <b>between $12 and $25</b> — after
                    transportation costs, which “oftentimes equal the cost to
                    recycle.” At the same time, in states that allow it, it
                    typically costs less than a dollar to dump a solar panel in
                    a solid waste landfill.

                    Does the clean energy generated from solar panels offset the
                    negative impacts during the mining and manufacturing

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Emission intensity is the lifetime (total) carbon emissions
                    evaluated per unit of energy. This is shown by grams of
                    carbon dioxide equivalent per kilowatt-hour
                    <b>(gC02e/kWh)</b> or an equivalent value, tons of carbon
                    dioxide equivalent per megawatt-hour (tC02/MWh). The lower
                    the emission intensity, the better the environmental impact,
                    as less CO2 is emitted to generate the same amount of
                    energy. While there are no global warming emissions
                    associated with generating electricity from solar energy,
                    there are emissions associated with other stages of the
                    solar life-cycle, including manufacturing, materials
                    transportation, installation, maintenance, and
                    decommissioning and dismantlement. Solar panels require
                    approximately 60% to 70% of their energy upfront,
                    approximately 25% during operation and approximately 5% to
                    20% following their productive life. Coal on the other hand
                    generated ~98% of its emissions during the operation process
                    (mining, transportation, combustion, etc.) and only 1%
                    during upstream and downstream processes. The life cycle
                    emission intensity of solar PV is approximately
                    <b>40 gC02/kWh</b>. The life cycle emission intensity of
                    coal is approximately 1,000 gC02/kWh. Even the worst
                    estimates for solar PV are still 3x better than the best
                    estimates for coal.

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    Solar power is not entirely green, but it doesn't mean we
                    should turn our backs on it. Its benefits are way too great
                    for that. Instead, we should openly address its problems and
                    figure out how we can fix them. Giving a second life to all
                    solar panel components would not only reduce the amount of
                    waste ending up in landfills but also shrink the demand for
                    new materials. Besides boosting in its early days, new
                    recycling technology could improve the recovery of PV
                    modules’ precious materials such as silicon and silver.
                    Although optimizing solar panels recycling may take a while,
                    It’s just a matter of time. What’s exciting is that, once
                    the kinks are worked out, this could lead to huge market
                    opportunities. It could be a win for the economy and the
                    environment if we start acting right now.
